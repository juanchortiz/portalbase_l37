## 🗄️ Cache Information

The app uses a local SQLite database (`base_cache.db`) to:
- Store all contract data locally
- Enable instant queries without API calls
- Auto-refresh daily (once per calendar day)

View cache statistics in the sidebar:
- Total contracts cached
- Total announcements cached
- Years in cache with last update time

---

## ⚡ Performance

- **First search of the day**: May take a moment (fetching from API)
- **Subsequent searches**: Instant (uses local cache)
- **189,342+ contracts** from 2025 already cached!
